| [SizeF](sizef/#constructor)(#=zWfgi6R$WbIywKCegIXZ99gI=) |  |
| [SizeF](sizef/#constructor_1)(SizeF) | Initializes a new instance of the `SizeF` structure from the specified existing `SizeF` structure. |
| [SizeF](sizef/#constructor_2)(float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the `SizeF` structure from the specified dimensions. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Height](../../aspose.page.drawing/sizef/height/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the vertical component of this `SizeF` structure. |
| [IsEmpty](../../aspose.page.drawing/sizef/isempty/) { get; } | Gets a value that indicates whether this `SizeF` structure has zero width and height. |
| [Width](../../aspose.page.drawing/sizef/width/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the horizontal component of this `SizeF` structure. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |

| override [Equals](../../aspose.page.drawing/sizef/equals/)(object) | Tests to see whether the specified object is a `SizeF` structure with the same dimensions as this `SizeF` structure. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.page.drawing/sizef/gethashcode/)() | Returns a hash code for this [`Size`](../size/) structure. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.page.drawing/sizef/tostring/)() | Creates a human-readable string that represents this `SizeF` structure. |
| [operator ==](../../aspose.page.drawing/sizef/op_equality/) | Tests whether two `SizeF` structures are equal. |
| [operator !=](../../aspose.page.drawing/sizef/op_inequality/) | Tests whether two `SizeF` structures are different. |
