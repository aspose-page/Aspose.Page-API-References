## PointF structure

Represents an ordered pair of floating-point x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane.

```csharp
public struct PointF
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PointF](pointf/)(float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the `PointF` class with the specified coordinates. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IsEmpty](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/isempty/) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this `PointF` is empty. |
| [X](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/x/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the x-coordinate of this `PointF`. |
| [Y](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/y/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the y-coordinate of this `PointF`. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Clone](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/clone/)() | Clones this Aspose.Page.Drawing.PointF. |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/equals/)(object) | Specifies whether this `PointF` contains the same coordinates as the specified Object. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/gethashcode/)() | Returns a hash code for this `PointF` structure. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/tostring/)() | Converts this `PointF` to a human readable string. |
| [operator ==](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/op_equality/) | Compares two `PointF` structures. The result specifies whether the values of the [`X`](./x/) and [`Y`](./y/) properties of the two `PointF` structures are equal. |
| [operator !=](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/op_inequality/) | Determines whether the coordinates of the specified points are not equal. |

## Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static readonly [Empty](../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/empty/) | Represents a new instance of the PointF class with member data left uninitialized. |
