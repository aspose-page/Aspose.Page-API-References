## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FromArgb](../../aspose.page.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb)(int) | Creates a `Color` structure from a 32-bit ARGB value. |
| static [FromArgb](../../aspose.page.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_1)(int, Color) | Creates a `Color` structure from the specified `Color` structure, but with the new specified alpha value. Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for the alpha value, the value is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromArgb](../../aspose.page.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_2)(int, int, int) | Creates a `Color` structure from the specified 8-bit color values (red, green, and blue). The alpha value is implicitly 255 (fully opaque). Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for each color component, the value of each component is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromArgb](../../aspose.page.drawing/color/fromargb/#fromargb_3)(int, int, int, int) | Creates a `Color` structure from the four ARGB component (alpha, red, green, and blue) values. Although this method allows a 32-bit value to be passed for each component, the value of each component is limited to 8 bits. |
| static [FromName](../../aspose.page.drawing/color/fromname/)(string) | Creates a `Color` structure from the specified name of a predefined color. |
| [Clone](../../aspose.page.drawing/color/clone/)() | Clones this Aspose.Page.Drawing.Color. |
