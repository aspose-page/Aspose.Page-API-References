## BitmapData class

Specifies the attributes of a bitmap image. The `BitmapData` class is used by the !:Overload:Aspose.Page.Drawing.Bitmap.LockBits and [`UnlockBits`](../../aspose.page.drawing/bitmap/unlockbits/) methods of the [`Bitmap`](../../aspose.page.drawing/bitmap/) class. Not inheritable.

```csharp
public sealed class BitmapData
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Height](../../aspose.page.drawing.imaging/bitmapdata/height/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the pixel height of the [`Bitmap`](../../aspose.page.drawing/bitmap/) object. Also sometimes referred to as the number of scan lines. |
| [PixelFormat](../../aspose.page.drawing.imaging/bitmapdata/pixelformat/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the format of the pixel information in the [`Bitmap`](../../aspose.page.drawing/bitmap/) object that returned this `BitmapData` object. |
| [Scan0](../../aspose.page.drawing.imaging/bitmapdata/scan0/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the address of the first pixel data in the bitmap. This can also be thought of as the first scan line in the bitmap. |
| [Stride](../../aspose.page.drawing.imaging/bitmapdata/stride/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the stride width (also called scan width) of the [`Bitmap`](../../aspose.page.drawing/bitmap/) object. |
| [Width](../../aspose.page.drawing.imaging/bitmapdata/width/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the pixel width of the [`Bitmap`](../../aspose.page.drawing/bitmap/) object. This can also be thought of as the number of pixels in one scan line. |
