## PixelFormat enumeration

Specifies the format of the color data for each pixel in the image.

```csharp
public enum PixelFormat
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Undefined | `0` | The pixel format is undefined. |
| Indexed | `65536` | The pixel data contains color-indexed values, which means the values are an index. to colors in the system color table, as opposed to individual color values. |
| Format24bppRgb | `137224` | Specifies that the format is 24 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the. red, green, and blue components.. |
| Format32bppRgb | `139273` | Specifies that the format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the. red, green, and blue components. The remaining 8 bits are not used. |
| Format1bppIndexed | `196865` | Specifies that the pixel format is 1 bit per pixel and that it uses indexed color. The color table therefore has two colors in it. |
| Format4bppIndexed | `197634` | Specifies that the format is 4 bits per pixel, indexed. |
| Format8bppIndexed | `198659` | Specifies that the format is 8 bits per pixel, indexed. The color table therefore. has 256 colors in it.. |
| Alpha | `262144` | The pixel data contains alpha values that are not premultiplied. |
| PAlpha | `524288` | The pixel format contains premultiplied alpha values. |
| Format32bppPArgb | `925707` | Specifies that the format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the. alpha, red, green, and blue components. The red, green, and blue components are. |
| Format16bppGrayScale | `1052676` | The pixel format is 16 bits per pixel. The color information specifies 65536. shades of gray.. |
| Format32bppArgb | `2498570` | Specifies that the format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the. alpha, red, green, and blue components. |
