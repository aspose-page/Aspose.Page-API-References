The **Aspose.Page.Drawing.Drawing2D** is a root namespace for System.Drawing.Drawing2D wrapper classes.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Blend](./blend/) | Defines a blend pattern for a [`LinearGradientBrush`](../aspose.page.drawing.drawing2d/lineargradientbrush/) object. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [ColorBlend](./colorblend/) | Defines arrays of colors and positions used for interpolating color blending in a multicolor gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [GradientBrush](./gradientbrush/) | This class is used for encapsulating GradientBrush and PathGradientBrush with possibility to set wrap mode to clamp. Native gradient brushes always throw an exception when someone tries to set WrapMode property to WrapMode.Clamp. |
| [GraphicsPath](./graphicspath/) | Represents a series of connected lines and curves. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [HatchBrush](./hatchbrush/) | Defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [LinearGradientBrush](./lineargradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a [`Brush`](../aspose.page.drawing/brush/) with a linear gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [Matrix](./matrix/) | Encapsulates a 3-by-3 affine matrix that represents a geometric transform. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [PathGradientBrush](./pathgradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a [`Brush`](../aspose.page.drawing/brush/) object that fills the interior of a [`GraphicsPath`](../aspose.page.drawing.drawing2d/graphicspath/) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DashCap](./dashcap/) | Specifies the type of graphic shape to use on both ends of each dash in a dashed line. |
| [DashStyle](./dashstyle/) | Specifies the style of dashed lines drawn with a [`Pen`](../aspose.page.drawing/pen/) object. |
| [FillMode](./fillmode/) | Specifies how the interior of a closed path is filled. |
| [HatchStyle](./hatchstyle/) | Specifies the different patterns available for System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush objects. |
| [InterpolationMode](./interpolationmode/) | The [`InterpolationMode`](../aspose.page.drawing.drawing2d/interpolationmode/) enumeration specifies the algorithm that is used when images are scaled or rotated. |
| [LinearGradientMode](./lineargradientmode/) | Specifies the direction of a linear gradient. |
| [LineCap](./linecap/) | Specifies the available cap styles with which a System.Drawing.Pen object can end a line. |
| [LineJoin](./linejoin/) | Specifies how to join consecutive line or curve segments in a figure (subpath) contained in a System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath object. |
| [MatrixOrder](./matrixorder/) | Specifies the order for matrix transform operations. |
| [SmoothingMode](./smoothingmode/) |  |
| [WarpMode](./warpmode/) | Specifies the type of warp transformation applied in a !:Overload:Aspose.Page.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Warp method. |
| [WrapMode](./wrapmode/) | Specifies how a texture or gradient is tiled when it is smaller than the area being filled. |
