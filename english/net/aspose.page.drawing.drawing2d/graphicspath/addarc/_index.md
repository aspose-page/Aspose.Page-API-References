## AddArc(RectangleF, float, float) {#addarc}

Appends an elliptical arc to the current figure.

```csharp
public void AddArc(RectangleF rect, float startAngle, float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rect | RectangleF | A [`RectangleF`](../../../aspose.page.drawing/rectanglef/) that represents the rectangular bounds of the ellipse from which the arc is taken. |
| startAngle | Single | The starting angle of the arc, measured in degrees clockwise from the x-axis. |
| sweepAngle | Single | The angle between *startAngle* and the end of the arc. |

```csharp
public void AddArc(float x, float y, float width, float height, float startAngle, float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | Single | The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangular region that defines the ellipse from which the arc is drawn. |
| y | Single | The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangular region that defines the ellipse from which the arc is drawn. |
| width | Single | The width of the rectangular region that defines the ellipse from which the arc is drawn. |
| height | Single | The height of the rectangular region that defines the ellipse from which the arc is drawn. |
| startAngle | Single | The starting angle of the arc, measured in degrees clockwise from the x-axis. |
| sweepAngle | Single | The angle between *startAngle* and the end of the arc. |
