## AddPie(RectangleF, float, float) {#addpie}

Adds the outline of a pie shape to this path.

```csharp
public void AddPie(RectangleF rect, float startAngle, float sweepAngle)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rect | RectangleF | A [`RectangleF`](../../../aspose.page.drawing/rectanglef/) that represents the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse from which the pie is drawn. |
| startAngle | Single | The starting angle for the pie section, measured in degrees clockwise from the x-axis. |
| sweepAngle | Single | The angle between *startAngle* and the end of the pie section, measured in degrees clockwise from *startAngle*. |
