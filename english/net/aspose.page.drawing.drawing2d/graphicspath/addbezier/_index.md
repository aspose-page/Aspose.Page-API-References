## AddBezier(PointF, PointF, PointF, PointF) {#addbezier}

Adds a cubic Bezier curve to the current figure.

```csharp
public void AddBezier(PointF pt1, PointF pt2, PointF pt3, PointF pt4)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pt1 | PointF | A [`PointF`](../../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/) that represents the starting point of the curve. |
| pt2 | PointF | A [`PointF`](../../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/) that represents the first control point for the curve. |
| pt3 | PointF | A [`PointF`](../../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/) that represents the second control point for the curve. |
| pt4 | PointF | A [`PointF`](../../../aspose.page.drawing/pointf/) that represents the endpoint of the curve. |
