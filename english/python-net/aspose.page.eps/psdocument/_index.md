## PsDocument class

This class encapsulates PS/EPS documents.

**Inheritance:** `PsDocument` â†’ [`Document`](/page/python-net/aspose.page/document)

The PsDocument type exposes the following members:
## Constructors

| :- | :- |
| `PsDocument()` | Initializes empty [PsDocument](/page/python-net/aspose.page.eps/psdocument/). This constructor is used only for additional operations that are not related to PostScript files,<br/>            for example, converting fonts. |
| `PsDocument(out_ps_file_path, options)` | Initializes a new instance of the PsDocument class |
| `PsDocument(out_ps_stream, options)` | Initializes a new instance of the PsDocument class |
| `PsDocument(out_ps_file_path, options, multipaged)` | Initializes a new instance of the PsDocument class |
| `PsDocument(out_ps_stream, options, multipaged)` | Initializes a new instance of the PsDocument class |
| `PsDocument(out_ps_file_path, options, number_of_pages)` | Initializes a new instance of the PsDocument class |
| `PsDocument(out_ps_stream, options, number_of_pages)` | Initializes a new instance of the PsDocument class |
| `PsDocument(ps_file_path)` | Initializes a new instance of the PsDocument class |
