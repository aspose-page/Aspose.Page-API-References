### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size/__init__/#int-int) | Initializes a new instance of the [`Size`](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size) class from the specified dimensions. |
| [__init__](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size/__init__/#) | Constructs a new instance of Size |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [height](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size/height) | Gets or sets the vertical component of this [`Size`](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size). |
| [width](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size/width) | Gets or sets the horizontal component of this [`Size`](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size). |
| [is_empty](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size/is_empty) | Tests whether this [`Size`](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size) has width and height of 0. |
| [EMPTY](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size/empty) | Gets a [`Size`](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size) structure that has a [`Size.height`](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size#height) and [`Size.width`](/page/python-net/aspose.page.drawing/size#width) value of 0. |
