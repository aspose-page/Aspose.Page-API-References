## stroke_thickness property


Returns/sets the thickness of a stroke, in units of
the effective coordinate space (includes the path's render transform).
The stroke is drawn on top of the boundary of the geometry specified
by the Path element’s Data property. Half of the StrokeThickness extends
outside of the geometry specified by the Data property and the other half
extends inside of the geometry.
