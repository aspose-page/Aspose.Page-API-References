## XpsTileMode enumeration

Valid values of tiling brushes' TileMode property.



The XpsTileMode type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NONE | In this mode, only the single base tile is drawn. The remaining area is left transparent. |
| TILE | In this mode, the base tile is drawn and the remaining area is filled by repeating the base<br/>tile such that the right edge of each tile abuts the left edge of the next, and the bottom<br/>edge of each tile abuts the top edge of the next. |
| FLIP_X | The tile arrangement is similar to the Tile tile mode, but alternate columns of tiles are<br/>flipped horizontally. The base tile is positioned as specified by the viewport. Tiles in<br/>the columns to the left and right of this tile are flipped horizontally. |
| FLIP_Y | The tile arrangement is similar to the Tile tile mode, but alternate rows of tiles are flipped<br/>vertically. The base tile is positioned as specified by the viewport. Rows above and below are<br/>flipped vertically. |
| FLIP_XY | The tile arrangement is similar to the Tile tile mode, but alternate columns of tiles are<br/>flipped horizontally and alternate rows of tiles are flipped vertically. The base tile is<br/>positioned as specified by the viewport. |
