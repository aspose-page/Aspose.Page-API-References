## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AssemblyConstants](./assemblyconstants/) | Defines the constants that participate in the license check for the component. These used to be defined directly as assembly attributes, but I moved them into separate class because in .NET Compact Framework I cannot access assembly attributes. Now the licensing code when compiled for the .NET Compact Framework uses these constants instead of the assembly attributes. |
| [BuildVersionInfo](./buildversioninfo/) | This class provides information about current product build. |
| [Device](./device/) | This class encapsulates rendering of document to abstract device. **Rendering** of the document is performed page by page. |
| [Document](./document/) | A superclass for all encapsulated documents. |
| [ExternalFontCache](./externalfontcache/) | Use this class to obtain font encapsulation in a form that is accepted by [Device](./device/). |
| [IGlyph](./iglyph/) | This interface give access to main parameters of glyphs. |
| [IInteractiveDevice](./iinteractivedevice/) | The interface defining interactive features processing methods. |
| [IMultiPageDevice](./imultipagedevice/) | This interface contains methods for manipulating multi-paged device. |
| [IMultiPageSaveOptions](./imultipagesaveoptions/) | Defines interface for setting page numbers for conversion. |
| [IMultiPartitionDevice](./imultipartitiondevice/) | Basic interface for multi-partition device. |
| [IStreamable](./istreamable/) | This interface is used for dervices that renders document to a stream. |
| [License](./license/) | Provides methods to license the component. |
| [Margins](./margins/) | This class encapsulates top, left, bottom and right margins. |
| [Metered](./metered/) | Provides methods to set metered key. |
| [NamespaceDoc](./namespacedoc/) | The **[Aspose.Page](./)** is a root namespace for all classes of [Aspose.Page](./) library which are either directly in it like **[Device](./device/)** or indirectly through several subnamespaces. |
| [SaveOptions](./saveoptions/) | This class contains options necessary for managing conversion process. |
| [UserProperties](./userproperties/) | Special property class which allows typed properties to be set and returned. It also allows the hookup of two default property objects to be searched if this property object does not contain the property. |
## Enums

| Enum | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EditionType](./editiontype/) | Specifies the edition type of the license. |
| [LicenseState](./licensestate/) | Represents possible license states. |
| [ProductType](./producttype/) | Which product of the license or black list : **Aspose** or Conholdate. |
| [TextRenderingMode](./textrenderingmode/) | This enum contains possible values for text rendering mode. |
| [Units](./units/) | This enum contains possible values for size units. |
