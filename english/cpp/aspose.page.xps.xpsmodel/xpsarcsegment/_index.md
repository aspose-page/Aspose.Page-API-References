## XpsArcSegment class


Class incapsulating ArcSegment element features. This element describes an elliptical arc.

```cpp
class XpsArcSegment : public Aspose::Page::XPS::XpsModel::XpsPathSegment
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Clone](./clone/)() | Clones this arc segment. |
| [get_IsLargeArc](./get_islargearc/)() const | Returns/sets value determining whether the arc is drawn with a sweep of 180 or greater. |
| [get_Point](./get_point/)() const | Returns/sets the endpoint of the elliptical arc. |
| [get_RotationAngle](./get_rotationangle/)() const | Returns/sets value indicating how the ellipse is rotated relative to the current coordinate system. |
| [get_Size](./get_size/)() const | Returns/sets the x and y radius of the elliptical arc as an x,y pair. |
| [get_SweepDirection](./get_sweepdirection/)() const | Returns/sets value specifying the direction in which the arc is drawn. |
| [set_IsLargeArc](./set_islargearc/)(bool) | Returns/sets value determining whether the arc is drawn with a sweep of 180 or greater. |
| [set_Point](./set_point/)(System::Drawing::PointF) | Returns/sets the endpoint of the elliptical arc. |
| [set_RotationAngle](./set_rotationangle/)(float) | Returns/sets value indicating how the ellipse is rotated relative to the current coordinate system. |
| [set_Size](./set_size/)(System::Drawing::SizeF) | Returns/sets the x and y radius of the elliptical arc as an x,y pair. |
| [set_SweepDirection](./set_sweepdirection/)(XpsSweepDirection) | Returns/sets value specifying the direction in which the arc is drawn. |
