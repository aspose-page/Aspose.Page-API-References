## XpsGradientStop class


Class incapsulating GradientStop element features. This element is used by both the LinearGradientBrush and RadialGradientBrush elements to define the location and range of color progression for rendering a gradient.

```cpp
class XpsGradientStop : public Aspose::Page::XPS::XpsModel::XpsObject
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Clone](./clone/)() | Clones this gradient stop. |
| [get_Color](./get_color/)() | The gradient stop color. |
| [get_Offset](./get_offset/)() const | Returns/sets the gradient offset. The offset indicates a point along the progression of the gradient at which a color is specified. Colors between gradient offsets in the progression are interpolated. |
