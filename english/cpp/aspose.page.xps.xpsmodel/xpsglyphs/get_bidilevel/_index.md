## XpsGlyphs::get_BidiLevel method


Returns/sets the value specifying the Unicode algorithm bidirectional nesting level. Even values imply left-to-right layout, odd values imply right-to-left layout. Right-to-left layout places the run origin at the right side of the first glyph, with positive advance widths (representing advances to the left) placing subsequent glyphs to the left of the previous glyph.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Page::XPS::XpsModel::XpsGlyphs::get_BidiLevel() const
```
