## XpsPath::set_StrokeThickness method


Returns/sets the thickness of a stroke, in units of the effective coordinate space (includes the path's render transform). The stroke is drawn on top of the boundary of the geometry specified by the Path element’s Data property. Half of the StrokeThickness extends outside of the geometry specified by the Data property and the other half extends inside of the geometry.

```cpp
void Aspose::Page::XPS::XpsModel::XpsPath::set_StrokeThickness(float value)
```
