Class incapsulating common features of tiling brushes elements (VisualBrush and ImageBrush).

```cpp
class XpsTilingBrush : public Aspose::Page::XPS::XpsModel::XpsTransformableBrush
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_TileMode](./get_tilemode/)() const | Returns/sets value specifying how tiling is performed in the filled geometry. |
| [get_Viewbox](./get_viewbox/)() const | Returns/sets the region of the source content of the brush that is to be mapped to the viewport. |
| [get_Viewport](./get_viewport/)() const | Returns/sets the position and dimensions of the first brush tile. Subsequent tiles are positioned relative to this tile, as specified by the tile mode. |
| [set_TileMode](./set_tilemode/)(XpsTileMode) | Returns/sets value specifying how tiling is performed in the filled geometry. |
| [set_Viewbox](./set_viewbox/)(System::Drawing::RectangleF) | Returns/sets the region of the source content of the brush that is to be mapped to the viewport. |
| [set_Viewport](./set_viewport/)(System::Drawing::RectangleF) | Returns/sets the position and dimensions of the first brush tile. Subsequent tiles are positioned relative to this tile, as specified by the tile mode. |
