## PsDocument::ResizeEps(System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\>, System::Drawing::SizeF, Units) method


Resizes given [PsDocument](../) as [EPS](../../) file. This method is used only after extracting [EPS](../../) size. It saves initial [EPS](../../) file with updated existing %BoundingBox or new one will be created. [Page](../../../aspose.page/) transformation matrix also will be set.

```cpp
void Aspose::Page::EPS::PsDocument::ResizeEps(System::SharedPtr<System::IO::Stream> epsStream, System::Drawing::SizeF newSizeInUnits, Units units)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| epsStream | System::SharedPtr\<System::IO::Stream\> | Stream of output [EPS](../../) file. |
| newSizeInUnits | System::Drawing::SizeF | New size of [EPS](../../) image in assigned units. |
| units | Units | The units of the new size. Can be points, inches, millimeters, centimeters and percents of initial size. |
