## ApsLoadOptions::set_TransparencyThreshold method


An integer value from 0 to 255 below which pixel of image that contains alpha values will be considered as fully transparent. PostScript doesn't support transparency, but can apply explicit mask above color image where some pixels will be fully opaque and some one's will be fully transparent. Transparency threshold is used for finding the best likeness of original and PostScript result. Default value is 255.

```cpp
void Aspose::Page::XPS::ApsLoadOptions::set_TransparencyThreshold(int32_t value)
```
