## Aspose::Page::Drawing::operator!=(const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color\&, const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color\&) method


Tests whether two specified [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color](../) structures are different.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Page::Drawing::operator!=(const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color &left, const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color &right)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| left | const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color\& | The [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color](../) that is to the left of the inequality operator. |
| right | const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color\& | The [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color](../) that is to the right of the inequality operator. |

### ReturnValue

true if the two [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Color](../) structures are different; otherwise, false.

## Aspose::Page::Drawing::operator!=(const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size\&, const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size\&) method


Tests whether two [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../) structures are different.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Page::Drawing::operator!=(const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size &sz1, const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size &sz2)
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sz1 | const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size\& | The [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../) structure on the left of the inequality operator. |
| sz2 | const Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size\& | The [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../) structure on the right of the inequality operator. |

### ReturnValue

true if *sz1*  and *sz2*  differ either in width or height; false if *sz1*  and *sz2*  are equal.
