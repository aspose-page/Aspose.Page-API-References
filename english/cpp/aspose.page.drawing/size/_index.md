## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Clone](./clone/)() | Clones this [Aspose.Page.Drawing.Size](./). |
| [Equals](./equals/)(System::SharedPtr\<System::Object\>) override | Tests to see whether the specified object is a [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../) with the same dimensions as this [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../). |
| [get_Height](./get_height/)() | Gets the vertical component of this [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../). |
| [get_IsEmpty](./get_isempty/)() | Tests whether this [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../) has width and height of 0. |
| [get_Width](./get_width/)() | Gets the horizontal component of this [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../). |
| [GetHashCode](./gethashcode/)() const override | Returns a hash code for this [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../) structure. |
| [set_Height](./set_height/)(int32_t) | Sets the vertical component of this [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../). |
| [set_Width](./set_width/)(int32_t) | Sets the horizontal component of this [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../). |
| [Size](./size/)(int32_t, int32_t) | Initializes a new instance of the [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../) class from the specified dimensions. |
| [Size](./size/)() |  |
| [ToString](./tostring/)() const override | Creates a human-readable string that represents this [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../). |
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Empty](./empty/) | Gets a [T:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size](../) structure that has a [P:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size::Height](../) and [P:Aspose::Page::Drawing::Size::Width](../) value of 0. |
